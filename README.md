Project Guidelines
The administrator's login credentials are fixed as follows: Username: 'admin' and Password: 'admin'. These credentials should not be stored in any file for security reasons.

Each bus can have any number of passengers, and a passenger can travel on any number of buses.

Available seats for each day should be calculated as: Total seats - tickets booked for that day.

Proper exception handling should be implemented for invalid data entry, such as duplicate usernames or bus names.
